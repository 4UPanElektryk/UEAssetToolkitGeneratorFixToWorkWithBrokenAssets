# UEAssetToolkitGenerator 
This is a work-in-progress .NET API/GUI to generate [UEAssetToolkit](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/UEAssetToolkit-Fixes) compatible JSON files. You must have .NET 6 installed to use. Also known as Cooked Asset Serializer (CAS).

## Usage
Please follow the [wiki]() for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.

## Credits
- LongerWarrior for almost all of the serialization code and modifying UAAPI/CUE4Parse to add new export types. 
- Archengius for developing the UEAssetToolkit in the first place.
- atenfyr for developing UAAPI/GUI which CAS builds on.
- CUE4Parse for having support for most asset types which CAS modifies for the UAAPI format - we hope in the future to drop UAAPI and purely base on CUE4Parse.
- Buckminsterfullerene for CAS GUI and various fixes/improvements.
- Narknon for bits and bobs with the parse tree and GUI changes, & helping out with testing.
