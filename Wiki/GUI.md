1. Path to unpacked Content folder.
2. Path to AssetRegistry.bin file in unpacked files.
3. Path to DefaultGame.ini config file in unpacked files.
4. Path to where you want the serialized JSON files to end up. It will make a new folder called `Game` and put the files inside of that.
5. Path to where you want your log/AssetTypes/AssetList files to be stored.
6. A collapsable tree to select the exact assets/directories within path 1 that you would like to parse. If you want to ignore this, you can simply tick all of the top level directory.
7. The UE version that your game uses.
8. Whether or not you want to overwrite your existing JSON files with new ones.
